List of source files:
comp3007_f18_101039154_a1_1.java

Compilation command: javac comp3007_f18_101039154_a1_1.java
Execution command: java comp3007_f18_101039154_a1_1

Operating Instructions:
1. Compile and run the program
2. Enter in a phrase you would like to see in Camel Acrostics
3. If you would like to redo the whole program, simply enter "Y" or "N" when prompted

Issues/Limitations:
When entering in a phrase, it was assumed (based on what the prof said in class) that there was no trickery when entering in
a phrase. So, this program does not check for consecutive spaces, or special characters.
