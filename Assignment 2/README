    i)  evaluate: takes an expression and outputs the calculated result as a floating value
	-How to use:
		-Enter "evaluate n" in ghci where n is an expression
		example: entering "evaluate (Plus (Lit 1) (Lit 4))" will output 5.0

    ii) stringRep: takes an expression and outputs a string representation of the expression
	-How to use:
		-Enter "stringRep n" in ghci where n is an expression
		example: entering "stringRep (Plus (Lit 1) (Minus(Lit 4) (Lit 3)))" will 
		output "(1.0 + (4.0 - 3.0))"
